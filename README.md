# Book Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering

This repository contains a collaborative filtering-based book recommender system built with Python Flask. The recommender system utilizes cosine similarity to suggest books based on user preferences and historical data.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering algorithm for personalized recommendations.
- Utilizes cosine similarity for efficient book similarity calculations.
- User-friendly interface built with Flask for easy interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/book-recommender.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd book-recommender`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
2. Access the book recommender system in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## How it Works
The recommender system analyzes user book ratings and similarities between books using cosine similarity. Based on this analysis, it generates personalized recommendations for users.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with additional data sources for broader book recommendations.
- Enhanced user interface with improved design and usability.
- Implementation of more advanced recommendation algorithms.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the project.
